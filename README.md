# Project-Iterations

## Coding guidelines
It is assumed that all submitted code will conform to the Google C++ style
guide. Read it. The following is a list of SOME of the things we will be
checking the code for. They are others--RTFM.
 - Usage of C++, not C-style casts
 - Not using of C-style memory allocation/copy operations
 - Usage of namespaces, including proper naming
 - Initialization of variables when they are declared
 - All 1 parameter constructors are marked explicit
 - All inheritance passes the 'is-a' test
 - All data members are private in each class
 - Proper ordering of declarations within a class (functions->data;
   public->protected->private)
 - All references passed to functions are labelled const.
 - Usage of nullptr, rather than NULL
 - Proper file naming
 - Proper function naming (use your discretion for "cheap")
 - Proper data member naming
 - Minimization of work performed in constructors
 - Not using exceptions
 - Proper commenting throughout the header files and source files

## Documenting your code
Students, you do not need to worry about documenting the code with doxygen style
comments until iteration 3. However, I would encourage you to document as you
go, to avoid having to document EVERYTHING all at once for iteration 3.

This does NOT mean that you can submit code without any comments for iteration 1
and 2. We will be expecting reasonable class, function, variable, and
algorithmic comments. If you have questions on the level we are expecting, look
at the iteration 1/iteration 2 base code. If you still have questions, see John.

### Running the linter
It is assumed that prior to handing in any iteration of the project, you will
run the following command on all source files (.cc AND .h) in your repository:

    python ext/cpplint/cpplint.py --linelength=81 <source files>

And that this command will report 0 errors found. You will be evaluated on an
all-or-nothing basis for this part of the project, so take care to do this. This
will NOT catch everything that is needed for Google C++ style, so reference to
the manual and the list above. Other tools are available that can check more
than cpplint--see John for details if you would like to incorporate more
automated checking into your workflow.

## Makefile hints
When compiling, we suggest you use the following set of compile flags in your
Makefile:

    -W -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -std=c++11

We will not enforce this, but compiling with all compiler warnings enabled as
above will help reduce the amount of headaches you have to endure for
overlooking something simple in the code (especially the -Weffc++ one). If you
want to be hardcore, add the following flags:

    -pedantic -Werror -Wswitch-default -Wfloat-equal -Wold-style-cast

## Makefile target rules
All submitted makefiles must build the main target when invoked exactly as
follows:

    make
    
The main target must be named exactly "BrushWork" and be built in a "bin/"
directory within your project root

## Invocation rules
Your BrushWork executable must not take any arguments, and be invoked exactly as
follows:

    bin/BrushWork

When run as described above, the build process must produce an executable called
BrushWork in the bin/ directory.

## Invocation rules
When run, your program must take 0 agruments and be invoked as follows:

    ./bin/BrushWork

## git commit message guidelines/rules
- There should only ever be ONE scope/module affected per commit message.
- If you have an 'and' in a commit subject, break it into 2 commits.
- No "In progress coding/debugging" commit messages

These are examples of the quality of the commit messages we will be expecting.

* feat(onUrlChange): Added new event to $browser
  - forward popstate event if available
  - forward hashchange event if popstate not available
  - do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available
  Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)

* docs(project): Updated fixed docs from Google Docs
  Couple of typos fixed:
  - indentation
  - batchLogbatchLog -> batchLog
  - start periodic checking
  - missing brace


If you have questions about whether something is appropriate, see John.
